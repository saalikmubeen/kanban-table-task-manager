# Tech Stack

- **React**: Best frontend library to ever exist.
- **TypeScript**: Did myself a favor by using TypeScript.
- **Headless UI**: For the modal and slideout components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For the styling and utility-first approach.
- **State Management**: Used React Context API for state management. Why overcomplicate things?
- **Local Storage**: For persisting task data. NNot building a unicorn startup here. Are we?
- **Vite**: For the build tooling. It's fast, like really fast.
